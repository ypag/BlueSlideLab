# BlueSlideLab
iOS app to learn about linear and periodic motion from observing swings real time.

This is part of my thesis at Carnegie Mellon University. 

The Blue Slide Laboratory engages young learners(4th- 8th grade) in educational and performative experiences at the playground by connecting physics and math principles to imaginative play and interaction using augmented reality technology.
